# Remote Meeting Lighting

A simple web tool to help use a spare screen as a light source during remote meetings. Hosted with [GitHub pages](https://gismya.github.io/remote-meeting-lighting/). It defaults to a pure white page, and the options provide adjustable color temperature settings to match ambient lighting conditions, along with custom color options for more creative control over your lighting.

## Acknowledgements

The color temperature conversion is based on [Tanner Helland's algorithm](https://tannerhelland.com/2012/09/18/convert-temperature-rgb-algorithm-code.html) for converting Kelvin temperatures to RGB values.
